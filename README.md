💻 Developed using Node.js and Express.js

Student: Sourav Paul
Project Type: Node.js (API + Axios Client)
Submission Task: Coursera/University Project

📘 Overview

The Book Review App is a Node.js-based application that allows users to browse, review, and manage books.
It supports both general users and registered users, with different tasks assigned for each role.

The app demonstrates:

API endpoints using Express.js

Client requests using Axios

Usage of async/await and Promises

CRUD operations for book reviews

⚙️ Technologies Used

Node.js

Express.js

Axios

Body-Parser

JavaScript (ES6)

🧠 How It Works
1️⃣ Start the server
node server.js


The Express app will start at:

http://localhost:3000

2️⃣ Run the client

Open a new Command Prompt in the same folder:

node client.js


You’ll see the output of various API calls such as:

Fetching all books

Searching by ISBN

Searching by author/title
